This project was done through the programming club Vikelabs, where I lead a team of 3 through the process of designing a functional website, from the initial idea and user research through to the finished product. The original inspiration stemmed from a constant struggle of finding an empty table during peak hours at the university. The front end is built in React, and the server is written in Go",

This website was an experiment with Angular and the database is hosted on Supabase. All of the data was taken from the Scryfall API.",
